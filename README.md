# ParelthonProjectsGML
A compilation of the projects I made using Game Maker Studio.

### TheLazyProject

An exploration on auto-tiling (rather than meticulously placing a specific tile sprite one by one, tile sprites recognize what neighbors they have and change sprite accordingly).

### Permissibility

This project was to try out if Game Maker Studio, a software for creating games can be used for creating interactive useful-looking applications

### TestingCircles
#### ColorfulCircles

I wanted to test out different easing functions and I like circles.

#### Cerulean

A playful mock-up of a interface that bares similarity to some kind of operating system's user interface. This was both a test to find out what easing functions can do and how "shaders" worked.

### WeatherApp

This was a test to try out how Game Maker's HTTP request events worked and see if I could create something that was not a game.
